Prompt: What is the capital of France?
Dear students, the capital of France is Paris.
It is expected an augmented prompting agent will include a metadata header that ensures traceability of information and explains the persona's influence. In this case, the AugmentedPromptAgent likely used its internal knowledge base, which may include facts about world capitals, to answer the prompt about the capital of France. The system prompt influenced the agent to respond in a formal and educational tone, consistent with that of a college professor.
